# 📦 Archived

Welcome to the **Archived** repository.

This space is dedicated to preserving my older projects that are no longer actively maintained or developed.

The vast majority of these projects are small, simple, and were created as assignments for my university course.

## 📝 Notes

- **fpcolumbofilia** is a simple website using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, made as a class assignment. The focus was on remaking the following [website](http://www.fpcolumbofilia.pt/) with a more modern design.
