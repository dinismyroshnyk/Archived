== üìù Notes

- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/C_Estruturas[C_Estruturas] is a collection of small exercises in C. The exercises were made as a class assignment for a data structures course. The focus was on understanding the basics of data structures and their implementation in C.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/CodeInsights[CodeInsights] is a collection of small exercises in C. The exercises were made as a class assignment for an introductory programming course. The focus was on understanding the basics of the C programming language.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/fpcolumbofilia[fpcolumbofilia] is a simple website using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, made as a class assignment. The focus was on remaking the following link:https://www.fpcolumbofilia.pt/[website] with a more modern design.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/Java[Java] is a collection of exercises in Java. The exercises were made as a class assignment and an introduction to OOP concepts.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/MySQL[MySQL] is a collection of exercises in MySQL. The exercises were made as a class assignment and an introduction to SQL and database management.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/tac-trabalho-pratico-1[tac-trabalho-pratico-1] is a simple traffic light simulation for arduino made as a class assignment. The program was developed using the help of the PlatformIO IDE extension for Visual Studio Code.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/tac-trabalho-pratico-2[tac-trabalho-pratico-2] was supposed to be a program that monitored the temperature in a room and controlled some leds and a servo motor based on the temperature. The tasks should be performed by 2 separate arduinos via serial communication and their data should be displayed on a website. This project was never completed.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/TP2v2[TP2v2] is a simple arduino program that monitors the temperature in a room and controls leds, a 7-segment display and a piezo buzzer based on the temperature. The focus was to understand state machines and how to implement them in an arduino program.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/Trabalho_Estruturas_1[Trabalho_Estruturas_1] is the first project for the data structures course from a different year. The project is a simple program that stores and manages clients' purchases from multiple fictional stores.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/Trabalho_Estruturas_2[Trabalho_Estruturas_2] is the final project for the data structures course from the same year as link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/Trabalho_Estruturas_1[Trabalho_Estruturas_1]. This project is the continuation of the previous project and adds more features to the program.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/trabalho-ed[trabalho-ed] is the final project for the same data structures course as the link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/C_Estruturas[C_Estruturas] project. The project is a simple program that simulates a banking system.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/TrabalhoFinal[TrabalhoFinal] is the final project for the same introductory programming course as the link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/CodeInsights[CodeInsights] project. The project is a simple program that helps users to manage tasks.
