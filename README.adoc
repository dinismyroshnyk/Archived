Welcome to the *Archived* repository.

This space is dedicated to preserving my older projects that are no longer actively maintained or developed.

The vast majority of these projects are small, simple, and were created as assignments for my university course.

== üìù Notes

- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/CodeInsights[CodeInsights] is a collection of small exercises in C. The exercises were made as a class assignment for an introductory programming course. The focus was on understanding the basics of the C programming language.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/fpcolumbofilia[fpcolumbofilia] is a simple website using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, made as a class assignment. The focus was on remaking the following link:https://www.fpcolumbofilia.pt/[website] with a more modern design.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/tac-trabalho-pratico-1[tac-trabalho-pratico-1] is a simple traffic light simulation for arduino made as a class assignment. The program was developed using the help of the PlatformIO IDE extension for Visual Studio Code.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/tac-trabalho-pratico-2[tac-trabalho-pratico-2] was supposed to be a program that monitored the temperature in a room and controlled some leds and a servo motor based on the temperature. The tasks should be performed by 2 separate arduinos via serial communication and their data should be displayed on a website. This project was never completed.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/trabalho-ed[trabalho-ed] is a simple program that simulates a bank system. The program was made as a class assignment for a data structures course. The focus was on understanding the basics of data structures and their implementation in C.
- link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/TrabalhoFinal[TrabalhoFinal] is the final project for the same introductory programming course as the link:https://github.com/dinismyroshnyk/Archived/tree/main/CodeInsights[CodeInsights] project. The project is a simple program that helps users to manage tasks.
